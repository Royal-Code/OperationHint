# OperationHint

Operation Hint is an application layer standard for informing the persistence layer in a decoupled way about the current operation to be performed.

This library offers a flexible solution for adding hints to the data repositories in your application,
inspired by EFCore's Query Hints.

These hints can be easily applied to query operations to modify the repository's behavior,
giving you greater control over data access.
